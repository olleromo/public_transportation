# Swedish Train Schedules

An app for finding train schedules in Sweden. It's part of the Udacity Senior Web Dev nano degree.


## Prerequisites

The backend is Clojure so if you want to run this you will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein repl

    => (-main)

and you should have a server running on port 3000

But - much simpler - You can see what it does if you go to [http://107.170.163.81:3000/] (http://107.170.163.81:3000/)
