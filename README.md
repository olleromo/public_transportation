# Swedish Train Schedules

An app for finding train schedules in Sweden. It's part of the Udacity Senior Web Dev nano degree.


## Prerequisites

The backend is Clojure so if you want to run this you will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

Do
        npm install

to pull in the javascript dependencies.

To start a Clojure web server, do:

    lein repl

    clj.server=> (-main)

The 'clj.server=>' part is the prompt you should be seeing.

Now - if the stars align - there is a server running on port 3000.

But, much simpler: you can see what it does if you go to [http://107.170.163.81:3000/] (http://107.170.163.81:3000/)
